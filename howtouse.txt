First of all you need to define a craft recipe 

Start Your admin panel you will see a new panel called Crafting Recepie 
There You can create a new recipe 

Result means the Ball that needed to be crafted 

ingredients Means the balls needed to craft the Result 

Quantity means how many of one ball is needed to craft 
Means if you change the quantity of a Ball named Sui dynasty to 2 so that means we need 2 Sui dynasty to craft 
After defining you can craft the Ball using the new /craft ball command Once it's crafted the balls used for crafting will be deleted Specials are not counted (you can change that in code of course)
